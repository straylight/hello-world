# Hello... World?

Learning new things, connecting them together. Hoping to cover:

- Golang
- Kubernetes Deployment
- Github Actions/Packages
- Cloud Hosting

## Starting...

I followed a [tutorial](https://www.coding-bootcamps.com/build-containerized-applications-with-golang-on-kubernetes/) on building a containerized kubernetes application in golang. The end result was a 3 pod deployment hosting the simple application.

## The plan...

Obviously, to learn; but also have fun. I want to keep learning since technology changes at an incredible pace. I want to use this repo as a way to track and showcase my progress.
